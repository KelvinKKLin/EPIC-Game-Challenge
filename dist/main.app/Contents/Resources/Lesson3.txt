Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Happy.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Welcome back, young one, to another lesson in Python Programming.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Happy.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Today, we will learn about math.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Up until now, you have been writing code to take input from a user, and to output it to the screen. But now, what if we want to do more than that?%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Let's say we have the user's age. Now, we want to make a program that will take that age, double it, and then output the result. How do we do that?%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Recall that inputs from the user are stored in variables, and that values inside variables have types. Luckily, Python makes it easy for you to do math using int, float, and long types.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%To add numbers, you would simply type <<number1>> + <<number2>>.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%To subtract numbers, you would use <<number1>> - <<number2>>%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%To multiply numbers, you would use: <<number1>>*<<number2>>%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%To exponentiate numbers (to put a number to the power of another number), you would use <<number1>>**<number2>>%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%And finally, to divide numbers, you would use <<number1>>/<<number2>>. Division is a little bit more complicated, but we'll discuss this later.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%So, in order to print the user's age double, I would simply write: print "Twice your current age is", age*2 where age is a variable containing the user's age.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Now try this: write a program that will ask the user for a number, and then print out that number squared.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Did you do it?%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%I wrote this:%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%number = input("Please input a number")%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%print "Your input squared is", (number**2)%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Happy.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Great work!%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Now, young one, let's take a closer look at division, since it is slightly different than the other operators.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%The thing is, when you divide two ints, Python will return an int.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%That means that if you try to do 1/2, Python will return 0. If you try to do 3/2, Python will return 1.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%In general, when you try to divide 2 ints, Python will return an int rounded towards negative infinity.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Now, how can we change this, so that Python will return a decimal? That is, how can we get 1/2 = 0.5?%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Well, Python will return a float number (i.e. a decimal number), if at least one of the terms on either side of the division sign (/) is a float. That means that we just have to type 1/2.0 or 1.0/2 instead of 1/2 to get 0.5.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%But if we want to divide two variables? Let's say we have the user's mark on a test, and the maximum number of marks the you could get on that test. How could we output his mark as a decimal?%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%If mark = 1, and maximumMark = 2, simply writing print mark/maximumMark would output 0.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%You also can't write print mark.0/maximumMark. That would cause an error.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%In order to get Python to return a decimal, we need to do something called type casting.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Type casting is essentially converting a value of one type to another. And in Python, that's really easy!%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%All you have to do is specify the type you want to convert to, and then in brackets, type the variable that you want to convert.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%So, let's convert our mark variable, which is an int, into a float. All we would have to do is type float(mark). How about maximumMark? Well, quite simply, we would write float(maximumMark).%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Putting this all together, in order to print the user's test grade as a decimal, we would have to type the following: print float(mark)/maximumMark. If mark = 1, and maximumMark = 2, this would output 0.5.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Sad.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Please be weary, young one, that there is inaccuracy in preforming floating point arithmetic. That is, floats are not very accurate, and relying on floating-point calculations could lead to some wrong results. Whenever possible, try to use ints instead of floats.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Now, back to type casting.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%In Python, you can cast data from one type to another. Not only can you cast an int to a float, but you can also cast a float back to an int using int(), or to a long using long(), or to a string using str(), or to a boolean using bool(). Try it, see what you can do with type casting!%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Now, before we end our lesson for today, I would like to go over one more crucial aspect of math in Python. %%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Right now, you know how to preform simple arithmetic operations. But what if we wanted to apply more complicated mathematical functions? That is, what if we wanted to find the cosine of a fraction, or if we wanted to take the square root of a number?%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Luckily, Python has a build in math library that will allow you to preform some of these operations. To access this library, simply type import math.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Now that you've imported math, whenever you want to access something in the math library, simply type math.<<function>> or math.<<variable>>. That is, if you wanted to find the cosine of a number, you would type math.cos(0). Or, if you wanted the value of pi, you would type math.pi.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%To take the square root of a number, simply type math.sqrt(x), where x is the number you want to take the square root of.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%There is a whole array of functions available in the math library, that unfortunately, young one, we won't be covering. If you are interested in learning more about the math library, feel free to read about it in the Python documentation. When your ready, try to write a program that takes in 2 numbers, representing the two legs of a right angle triangle, and output the length of the hypotenuse. (Hint: Use the formula a**2 + b**2 = c**2)%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Did you get it?%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%This is what I did:%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%import math%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%a = input("Please enter the length of the first leg: ")%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%b = input("Please input the length of the second leg: ")%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%print "The length of the third leg is", math.sqrt((a**2) + (b**2))%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%And so we have it.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Happy.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Today, young one, you took your first steps in using the math library in Python. You learned not only how to preform simple calculations in Python, but you also learned how to use more complicated mathematical functions provided by the math library.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Happy.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%You learned about integer division, and type casting.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei_Happy.png%%Sensei.png%%Professor Sensei%%Looking back a few lessons, you were still a fledgeling in programming, and now look at you. You are almost ready to take on the world of programming. Great work!%%0%%0
