Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei.png%%Sensei_Happy.png%%Professor Sensei%%First of all, what exactly is a computer? Well, a computer is a piece of technology that can take in, manipulate, and output information.%%0%%0
Blackboard.jpg%%Sensei.png%%Sensei_Happy.png%%Professor Sensei%%And a computer program? Think of a computer program as a very, very detailed instruction manual. The computer can read the instructions you give it, in a language that you both recognize and understand, and perform tasks based on the instructions it is given. When a computer reads the instructions you have given it, it is called EXECUTING A PROGRAM. All of what you see, physically, in a computer is the HARDWARE. The things you don't see, the programs and files, are known as SOFTWARE. Similar to how you have a brain that is stored in your body to complete tasks, the computer's hardware is necessary to hold and process its software. Programming is a communication between the human and the machine; something that should not simply be shrugged off.%%0%%0

Although the term computer science sounds like it is the study of computers, it isn't. Computers are merely a tool to carry out computer science, the same way a whiteboard is a tool to carry out math for a mathemetician. Computer science is, at it's core, the study of what can be done with computers.%%0%%0
