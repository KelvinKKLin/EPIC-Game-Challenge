- They reduce code duplication
- Easier to maintain 
- Easier to read

Blackboard%%%%%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Functions are subprograms - small program inside a program  
The part of the function that creates a function is called the function definition %%0%%0
Blackboard%%%%%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%When a function is used in a program we say that the function is called/invoked
- functions can be called multiple times within a program%%0%%0
Blackboard%%%%%%Sensei_Nutral.png%%Parameters

Parameters are variables that are initialized when a function is called
- we need to supply the function with parameters so that it can be invoked 
- formal parameters -> parameters given to the main function 
- actual parameters -> parametres passed on from the main function 

When a function has several parameters, the actual parameters are matched up with formal parameters by position %%0%%0
